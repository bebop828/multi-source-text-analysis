Almost heaven West Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains Shenandoah River Life is old there Older than the trees Younger than the mountains Growing like a breeze country road Take me home to the place I belong West Virginia Mountain mama take me home country road all my memories gather round her Miners lady Stranger to blue water Dark and dusty Painted on the sky Misty taste of moonshine Teardrop in my country road Take me home to the place I belong West Virginia Mountain mama take me home country road I hear her voice in the morning hours she calls me the radio reminds me of my home far away Driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday Yesterday country road Take me home to the place I belong West Virginia Mountain mama take me home country road country roads Take me home to the place I belong West Virginia Grand Mama take me home country road Take me home country road Take me home country road.
